# reactivity-from-scratch


I just read this [article](https://dev.to/emnudge/from-scratch-reactive-values-c9h) as introduction
but some of the things explained here are confuse for me, and I want to get even more in reactivity too.

this article don't speack about reactivity with proxy object.

I think reactivity is a great subject and It will be a great tools for future projects. (tails ?)

Finally,

My plan is to have a basic understanding of how implement reactivity in vanilla JS. With that I'll compare it with the vue js code implementation
and after maybe create my lib in another language like Rust.

note :

WeakSet interable ?
